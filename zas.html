          <h2>Zhen spends too much time addressing inquiries for services he does not provide.</h2>
          <h5>
            Zhen is the sole proprieter of Zhen's Appliance Service. He manages appliance repair orders on a daily basis. Lately, he has been receiving too many calls, texts, and emails on questions regarding services he cannot provide. 
          </h5>
          <h5>
            How do we balance providing users what they're looking for regarding appliance repair services, while also minimizing inquiries from users that Zhen cannot service?

          Zhen wants to minimize responding to inquiries from people outside his target audience.
        </h2>

        <h5>
          I sat down with Zhen to understand his target audience and uncover his pain points regarding the overall problem. My goal here was to gauge Zhen's business goals, so I could later connect them to those of his users to provide a cohesive solution.

        <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>

        <h2>
          The competition lacked credibility and refinement. 
        </h2>

        <h5>
          I analyzed two existing websites for appliance repair services in Seattle to determine any gaps that we could use to make ZAS stand out. Though both websites provided a wider range of services - more brands, teams, and larger service area - they lacked "local handyman" charm. Zhen provides high quality service through his product knowledge and personality as a one man team. His 5-star reviews Google and Yelp prove attest to this, while the competition claims they do but do not share testimonials.
        </h5>
        <h5>
          Additionally, both sites have established brands and coloring schemes but provide an overwhelming amount of information. Their overall UI and image quality could be improved.
        </h5>

      <!-- User Survey -->
      <div class="project-sub-section">
        <h4>USER SURVEY</h4>

        <h2>Survey participants prioritized wait time and friendly service in their in-home repair experiences.</h2>

        <h5>
          Because the solution to our customers' problems and our target audience were already established, the research goals of this survey were to determine what users value when searching for in-home services.  
        </h5>
        <h5>
          I conducted a user survey to identify what users value most when searching for in-home services. Appliance repair service was rather specific, so my survey participants were any that have received some sort of service that came to their homes. I compiled the survey data using affinity maps and uncovered several major insights. 
        </h5>

        <h4>KEY RESEARCH INSIGHTS</h4>

        <h2>Adjusting information architecture to put user service priorities in the forefront.</h2>

        <h5>Based on the affinity maps trends, I noticed interviewees actually prioritized prompt, friendly, and communicative service over the actual service. Their best experiences with in-home services involved repair-people that took the time to understand, assess, and explain the situation. The interviewees' first tasks were to look at reviews in search of this friendly service. These insights were all things to keep in mind when defining the new site architecture.</h5>

      <h4>IDEATION</h4>

      <h2>Expanding on existing low fidelity wireframes.</h2>

      <h5>
        This redesign actually started with another designer who didn't have the time to complete the project. I reached out to them to understand what they had gotten done and found that they had started on lo-fi wireframes. I had them share the wireframes with me to expand and inject my research into them. 
      </h5>
      <h5>
        From my research, the major changes I made to the previous designers wireframes were adding a testimonial tab, removing irrelevant information, and moving info around based on user wants. 
      </h5>

      <h2>Re-creating the responsive web application.</h2>

      <h5>
        Based on company resources and team expertise, the front-end developer of the previous site and I decided utilizing old assets and frameworks and re-creating the responsive web app was the most realistic solution for this project. At this point, I created mid fidelity wireframes for the site in varying screen sizes and added writing content.

      <h4>MOOD BOARD + HIGH-FIDELITY</h4>

      <h2>Developing Zhen's brand for style consistency.</h2>

      <h5>
        I created a mood board to depict my vision for Zhen's new website. The goal was to provide a color scheme and theme that welcomed users and accentuated friendly service. I worked with the client to adjust their new brand direction and ensure it fit their vision for the company. After establishing the right color scheme and branding, I created basic high fidelty wireframes for usability testing.

      <h2>Making 3 major improvements to the design.</h2>

      <h5>
        I conducted usability tests to observe how six financial management app users navigated through the prototype. I grouped the data using affinity maps and organized trends using a rainbow spreadsheet to prioritize usability errors concerning app functionality. I continuously iterated on the design based on test participant feedback and visual and accessibility guidelines to address these errors.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>

      <h2>What were my key learnings and takeaways from my first client project.</h2>

      <h5>Payd was the first UX project that I worked on from concept to completion! It definitely isn't perfect, but was a great place for me to start. In addition to many UX methodologies, I learned many important lessons that I'll take with me to my next project ðŸ˜Š</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h5><strong>Research vs. interview questions.</strong> 
            While working on this project, I learned the difference between research and interview questions. I know now that when gathering qualitative information, it's important to keep interview questions open ended and non-leading.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5><strong>Done is better than perfect - keep on iterating.</strong> 
          I got a bit lost in the sauce while tweaking minor details. I've learned that perfecting the visual design is not a priority for early hi-fi. I should have turned in minor iterations more frequently, rather than making bulk changes. This would have allowed me to focus on functionality and keep from being overwhelmed.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5><strong>Insight vs. process driven design.</strong> 
          I realized while working on this case study that showing what was pertinent to the problem space was much more valuable than completing and showing off processes. Moving forward, I have a better understanding of what processes to use, when to use them, and how they deliver insights that affect the bigger picture - rather than doing them just to do them.
