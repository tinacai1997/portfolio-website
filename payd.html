                Before laying out Payd's information architecture, I performed a content audit of the existing financial management app, Intuit: Mint.
                <br>
                Using the content audit data, I created an initial site map for Payd. To assess the understandability of my site map, I conducted an online card-sort to compare my map and page groupings with what my intended users would expect. I used this data to update my site map to provide an information architecture that better matched my users' expectations for the structure of an e-wallet app. This post card-sort site map provided a foundation for the screen structure that I would follow when wireframing.

            <h3>LOW FIDELITY</h3>
            <p>
              With the core functions and information architecture I had developed in hand, I began sketching lo-fi wireframes for Payd. In these wireframes, I had actually sketched the expense core function, rather than the login/sign up function identified in my user flows. Perhaps sketching the expense functions without considering its user flows and scenarios were what led to some complications later down the road- but we'll get to that soon. Nevertheless, creating these lo-fi wireframes allowed me to play around with ideas before committing to a specific solution.

            <h3>MID FIDELITY</h3>
            <p>
              I used Balsamiq to refine the functions of Payd through mid-fi wireframes. With these wireframes, I was able to better articulate my ideas for solving my user's needs and goals. This step gave structure and content to the initial thoughts I produced during lo-fi.

            <p>
              I used Adobe XD to create my first iteration of hi-fi wireframes. These wireframes were the starting point of the UI and formal structure of Payd. Before spending too much further time on visual aspects, I connected these wireframes to create an interactable prototype. This prototype was used to gather feedback on whether my solutions were useful and usable through usability testing.

              I conducted usability tests with our intended user groups to assess the usability of Payd's core functions through the following scenarios:
            </p>

            <!-- Usability Testing Scenarios -->

            </div>

            <p>
              During sessions, I observed how participant's navigated through the app and recorded my observations. I then used affinity maps again to compile this data into categories.

            <h3>RAINBOW SPREADSHEET</h3>
            <p>
              Using the data grouped in my second set of affinity maps, I created a rainbow spreadsheet to provide a different perspective on the affinity map data. Importantly, the rainbow spreadsheet identified critical errors and rated their severity based on recurrence and purpose of function.
            </p>

            <img src="#" alt="Rainbow Spreadsheet">

            <p>
              The spreadsheet uncovered several important errors to address. Notably, most participants had trouble with scenario #3 (as I alluded to before). Users felt there were too many elements within those screens and most had unclear purposes. Additionally, most participants could not identify certain visual elements, like the sliding window. Given this list of errors, I was able to prioritize which to address based on impact and effort to create the next hi-fi wireframe iteration.

              After addressing feedback from my usability tests and iterating on my design, I started the next step in my iteration process: visual design. This step involved reviewing Gestalt's design principles and emotional design to convert Payd from grey scale, to a gradient of color and structure. These visual decisions continually built upon as I improved the UI of Payd.

            <h3>iOS HUMAN GUIDELINES</h3>
            <p>
              I studied the iOS human guidelines to give further direction on the structure of the elements in Payd. A significant change I made following this review was Payd's navigation. The clear path guideline indicated that the pathways to tasks be fast and easy to get to. This iteration is where I ultimately decided to separate the two sub-tabs within the Expense tab into two main tabs of their own. I think this change was needed as it certainly helped declutter the confusion from scenario #3 from usability testing.

              I further focused on improving the UI and functionality of my app by catering to users with various disabilities. These improvements were based on my review of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and good accessible designs. Importantly, the Show Location guideline played a crucial role in updating my tab bar yet again. The home tab was added and the cards tab removed to help users understand where they are within Payd.
