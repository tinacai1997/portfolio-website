            The goal of this portfolio is to provide a platform to showcase my work and introduce myself into the design industry.

          <p>
            This project also serves as a medium for me to practice and demonstrate my understanding of front-end development and web design.

            <p>
              I used GitHub Desktop to create a repository for my work. This was useful because it allowed me to back-up, commit, and track my changes as I worked on my portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
              I anticipate when I work on team projects, GitHub will be even more useful for reviewing collective work and making changes on separate files. Even though my portfolio is a solo project, sharing it on GitHub felt like good practice.

              I began writing CSS rules to emulate the sample wireframes style and element positioning. But the more I wrote, refreshed chrome, and saw my website coming together, the more I felt like it wasn't my style.

            <h4>Low fidelity wireframes (again)</h4>
            <p>
              Unsatisfied with the sample wireframes, I began sketching my own lo-fi wireframes in pencil and paper. As I sketched, I annotated my micro-animation ideas to make my portfolio more unique and personal. I was sure to keep the structure as close I could to the original while still adding my own flair, so I could re-use most of my already established HTML documents.

          </section>

          <!-- Hifi -->
          <section>
            <h4>High fidelity wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              Although I appreciated the sample wireframes being lo-fi to allow room for creativity, I felt like I was making design decisions as I went and was constantly second guessing minor details.
            </p>
            <p>
              I knew I needed more refined wireframes to guide my portfolio's design.
              After all, I wouldn't pass a lo-fi wireframe straight to development, as that would lead to repeat work when the design transitions to hi-fi.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used Adobe XD to bring what I sketched to life through hi-fi wireframes. With XD, I was able to depict exactly what I wanted my portfolio to look like, which provided a guideline for me to stick to, and ease of mind from not having to design as I go.

            <h4>Mobile wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I focused on designing my wireframes with a mobile-first approach. My aim was to both <b>keep my focus on content</b> rather than visual flair (desktop button hovers, animations, etc.) and <b>ensure accessibility</b> for the smallest available screen (iPhone 5SE).
            </p>

          </section>

          <!-- HTML (again) -->
          <section>

            <h4>HTML (again)</h4>
            <p>
              Armed with an understanding of the new structure of my website, I modified the HTML using Atom to match. These modifications were minimal, as I had decided to keep most of the actual structure as similar as I could.
            </p>

              Now that I had a true guideline for my portfolio, I knew exactly what my end goal looked like once I typed that last line of CSS and hit refresh. I finished writing my CSS stylesheets to emulate the mobile wireframes I had mocked up.

            <p>
              After resolving the errors identified in the rainbow spreadsheet, I began refining Payd's visual design. Utilizing Gestalt's design principles and emotional design, Payd transitioned from grey scale to a gradient of color and structure.

          <!-- iOS Human Guidelines -->
          <section>
            <h4>iOS human guidelines</h4>
            <p>
              Making my design unique is what sets me apart from competitors. However, it's important to understand and stick to what works. I studied iOS human guidelines to improve Payd's understandability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this review, I made a significant change to Payd's navigation to adhere to the "Clear Path" guideline. I decided to separate the Expense tab's sub-tabs into their own individual tabs. This change provided a clearer path for users to complete their tasks, and certainly further decluttered the confusion from usability test task #3.

            <h4>Designing for accessibility</h4>
            <p>
              Making products and services usable for all is the essence of UX design. I improved on Payd's accessibility to cater to users with disabilities by studying the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

              The <b>"Show Location"</b> guideline led me to update the navigation bar again by adding a Home tab and removing the Cards tab. This change should help users understand where they are within the app.

              Below is the new and improved site map.

              <h4>User testing earlier</h4>
              <p>
                I made a lot of iterations on my hi-fi wireframes that I feel could and should have come earlier. If I had performed usability tests on mid-fi wireframes, I could have focused on testing functionality alone, rather than focus on hi-fi details that ended up getting scrapped anyway.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Avoid tunneling on details</h4>
              <p>
                I learned during this project that done is better than perfect.

            <li>
              <h4>Design with personas in mind</h4>
              <p>
                My personas were defined as a reference to look back to and aim to solve problems for. I found as I focused on the small details, I lost sight of my personas at times.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Understandable interview questions</h4>
              <p>
                I found during my user interviews and usability tests that the specificity and clarity of my questions were incredibly important, both for the sake of the data I collect and my participants that are volunteering their time to help me. There were some questions that I could have worded better.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Review guidelines earlier</h4>
              <p>
                I didn't touch on the iOS human or accessibility guidelines until late in the game. In my future projects, I'd work toward putting accessible and recognizable designs in the forefront of the design process.
