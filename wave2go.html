              The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) receives too many calls and emails requesting support for purchasing ferry tickets. Their current ticket site is difficult to navigate, therefore users cannot confidently follow through with purchasing ferry tickets without help.
            </h5>
            <h5>
              The business goal for WSDOT is to <strong>increase self service success</strong> for their ferry ticketing site.

            <strong><u>Who</u> are we designing for?</strong>
          </h5>
          <h5>
            With just a few hours to complete this design challenge, I needed to pinpoint a specific user group to focus my design toward. This gave me a direction for ideation by narrowing the design scope, otherwise I could have redesigned for hours. I chose to split my user options by age group:
          </h5>
          <h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Young student</li>
              <li>Middle aged professional</li>
              <li><strong>Elderly and retired</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </h5>
          <h5>
            I chose to focus on elderly users because I felt they would struggle most with using a website and were more likely to contact WSDOT for inquiries. I anticipated the solutions I designed for this group would encapsulate problems younger users might face with the site as well.

            <strong><u>What</u> are some struggles elderly users might face with the client's service that led to the business goal?</strong>
          </h5>
          <h5>Here, I attempted to put myself in my users' shoes and identify some of their painpoints relative to the business goal:</h5>
          <h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Don't often plan their own trips</li>
              <li>Not well-versed in purchasing tickets online</li>
              <li>Unfamiliar with logistics that go along with boarding a ferry</li>
            </ul>
          </h5>
          <h5>
            The common theme here is that the elderly are missing crucial information in the steps required for buying and using ferry tickets.

              <p><strong>Other Ideas:</strong> If I had more time to expand on this project, I'd look toward some of the design ideas I didn't prioritize in this case study.</p>

              <p><strong>High-fi wireframes:</strong>
              The next steps for this project would be to work on bringing our lo-fi wireframes into hi-fi. Since this site already exists, and my designs were intentionally kept minimal and specific, I believe we'd be ok to skip the mid-fi step and move onto hi-fi mockups, to provide visuals for our clients so they can have a clearer idea of the solution and begin development.s
